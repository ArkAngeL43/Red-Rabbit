    <p style="text-align: center; color: whitesmoke;">
        I would like to say to everyone thank you for the amazing support over this <br>
        Major FUCKING MASSIVE ass project, when i first released the script i was not <br>
        exepecting anything like this, i wasnt even expecting to release another version  <br>
        But god damnit yall crazy mother fuckers got to my head and made mr produce a much  <br>
        much much MUCH better version, i appreicate the motivation, i appreicate the support  <br>
        and i damn well appreicate the love i have been getting all throughout this project  <br>
        <br>
        i would also love to give a shoutout to the following people  
        <br>
        Chris patten  <br>
        Dan Kottmann <br>
        Tom Steele <br>
        Sabri Saleh Hassanyah <br>
        the RR5 project contributors <br> 
        Parrot assassin 15  <br>
        and Adam Woodbeck  <br>
        <br>
        for making this project possible, it was because of their knowlege sharing i was able to  <br>
        properly grasp onto Socket development and cyber weapons development with GOlang and Ruby and other <br> 
        languages such as C and assembly, i truly suggest reading their books such as Black hat Ruby anng Black Hat Go <br>
        it was worth the read and got me a really far start in the cyber security community <br>
    </p>

        General information about RR5 and etc scripts
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; color: whitesmoke;">
        This entire script was built on many many other sub scripts as i like to call them but  <br>
        instead of making a CLI only tool i decided to adsd a web documentaion, note that this  <br>
        is in beta and yes there will be updates to it and what not the actuall RR5 documentation server <br> 
        which is activated by entering the command : doc-dem : and is held on http://localhost:8080 <br>
        is the most finished web interface in this file, its simply because as of now i am the only dev  <br>
        of this project asides https://instagram.com/parrotassassin15 helping me out with some recon scripts  <br>
        and general design. so the time on this project was limited considering i had already stretched it  <br>
        well over a few months. This is a pretty decent UI considering i couldnt fit literally everything in  <br>
        a organized wiki and ontop of it why not? kinda makes it nicer in a way <br>
