this module is for FTP brute forcing and is very very simple to understand, just 

like the SSH brute forcing, you will need a wordlist, a host, a port, and a username

when you use the command FTP-b you will be prompted for the following 

FTP user 
FTP port 
FTP IPA 
Wordlist you want to use 

this is all the information that is needed, note the wordlist is better off if it is

in the RR5 directory but if you have it outside or in another directory note you will have

to specify its specific path ex

/usr/share/worldists/rockyou.txt

or 

/home/ruser/Desktop/name/files/filenames/wordlists/rockyou.txt

~ works as well

as said there really isnt much to this module other than what is needed and its over all usage 

if something does happen where the connection is refused then you will get the output

```
FATAL: WARN: TO EXIT PLEASE PRESS CTRL+C
CONNECTION REFUSED ATTEMPTED ON -> #{ipa} - PORT -> #{po} WITH USER -> #{user} ON PASSWORD #{line}
```

if else it will continue to brute force and you will get live updates about it as well
