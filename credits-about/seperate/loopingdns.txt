in RR5 i have a command set named dm-b which stands for domain blocker, this takes a file 

of hosts ex: www.example.com and attempts to block them and loop the conections through your 

loopback to make it sure that this website can not access your computer, while also blocking 

you from accessing it as well


i imagine this one can be quite confusing but in the RR5 main file there is a file labeled 

config-files, this is the configuration file path for every single tool that needs a configuration file

in that filepath there is a file labeled `blacklist.txt` this is the file where you will store 

all the hostnames you want to block `note only websites can be written as of now, currently adding support`

lets say i wanted to block the website `www.scanme.org` from my computer and not allow myself to make a connection 

between my pc and the server on the other side 

i would simply edit this txt file with the name 


````
www.scanme.com 
````

save it then run RR5 followed by the command dm-b

** NOTE: you can use your own filepath, this is just an easier in for the tool and instead of making 

  or creating your own its best to have it pre setup **


lets make an example for further inspection of how this works without confusion 

so i have my home directory and in that dir rr5 lays here is what i will input when the script asks me for a filepath


/home/user/RR5/config-files/blacklist.txt

it prevents the error 


````
2021/12/25 19:55:17 open config-files/blacklist.txt: no such file or directory
````

despite you being in the RR5 filepath dring execution, simply cause each tool is stored in its own topic 

and filepath which can not be opened if the script has it names /modules when the filepath is /config if you 

generally get what i am saying it is easier to work around this.
