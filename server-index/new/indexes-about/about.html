      from the list above. Another example of how modules will be seperated is by the cloumn number in the chart above where Brute is the second module name, its section will 
      be labeled 0x0002 - BRUTE -, please take your time going through the documentation ALOT of people often forget about documentation then come to the devs confused as to 
      why some dont work, or how the script works and how to use it, so please, when i mean read it i mean READ IT CAREFULLY!

    <div class="Base_Text">
        Section 0x102 will be talking about what the red 
        rabbit project is and what it aims to be
    <hr>
    <div class="pstart">
      What is the red rabbit project?
    </div>

    The red rabbit project is a offensive security project 
    and framework that has been an idea for quite a while
    just now intorducing version 1.0 the very first version out 
    of beta there are over 200+ commands to this script. Red rabbit 
    has been a quite big project for a while now, longer than most think 
    it just took a little extra longer to take those ideas and turn 
    them into reality. Red rabbit has version .1 - .5 before it got 
    released to version 1.0, and in those versions it was a mess, such a 
    mess that it was actually turning people away. So red rabbit finally 
    came back with a punch, a real hard hitter this time that might do the 
    opposite of what it did before. 


    <div class="pstart">
      What is different in the project 
      from the previous beta versions?
    </div>

    Red Rabbit used to be a trashy built, half scrapped 
    laggy, over bloated, huge, and over popular framework
    but now not only does it have way more utilities but 
    it also has way more functions, its way more improoved 
    way more easier to use, way more faster, way more functional 
    way more useable, way more detailed and 100+ more things.
    back in the beta version of red rabbit it went through a
    series of using multiple languages such as rust, ruby, go,
    perl, python, etc now it uses just go with a backend enforcer 
    of perl to power GUI's, smaller tools and utils, digital 
    forensics and other tools.

    <div class="pstart">
      What does red rabbit aim to be?
    </div>

    Red rabbit aims to be a free open sourcr framework 
    not just for hackers but for digital foresnics experts,
    OSINT experts, mathematical wizzes, web exploitation 
    specialists, wifi pentesters and so much more all around 
    red rabbit aims to be not only one of the best but one of 
    the most helpful platforms out there, frameworks like wifite,
    brute spray, hydra, and nmap are all amazing frameworks but all 
    aim twards a specific group of people, alot of projects and tools 
    used in red rabbit were inspired by these tools and utilities to make 
    a better platform but from raw source. Alot of people liked to claim 
    the project aimed to be better and claimed it was better than MSF but 
    that in fact is NOT true, this projects aims to be the complete opposite
    of wifite, nmap, MSF, and even aircrck, the project actually aims to be 
    a very simple, plain, and laid out framework that can touch as much fields 
    of hacking as possible that are out there, wether its hash attacks and 
    cryptographic attack scripts or it is simple host discovery. 

    <div class="pstart">
        What is the red rabbit project based off of?
    </div>

    Red Rabbit itself is special, it does not aim to 
    be like, be, or act as another framework nor does 
    it automate other frameworks, it was not even based 
    off of anything. However the main structure or idea 
    of this framework / technical base comes from older 
    the idea of creating omething different from every 
    other everyday framework out there. Red Rabbit as a
    project does not want to be the face of another project 
    it simply just wants to be one of the better projects 
    out there with raw utilities rather than what it was 
    in its first section which was basically system commands 
    line after line after line. 

    <div class="pstart">
      What does Red Rabbit want to be 
      in the further future?
    </div>

    Red Rabbit aim to be better and better each version, 
    more commands and more functions and more features 
    will keep getting added to the script, with more customization.
    The reason to keep this project up is because it just 
    is one of those frameworks you dont see. You dont everyday 
    wake up and go to github and find a framework that trys to 
    touch on every field of hacking or has complex outputs 
    or even has user customization. 

    <div class="pstart">
      What does red rabbit have 
      that differs from other frameworks?
      and why does it try to touch on every 
      topic of most hacking fields.
    </div> 

    Red Rabbit has about a 100+ differences from 
    other projects out there. While red rabbit is a framework 
    as said above it is NOT the everyday framework it does not 
    want to be nor does it aim to be. The project strives to be 
    something you have yet to see in this hacking world or IT world 
    and be what other frameworks arent. Most framework are designed 
    to a very specific topic ( which is good in cases like MSF) or 
    other frameworks just have 3 or 5 commands that can either trace 
    an IP or grab small information ofc do not think the devs of this 
    project are hating we arent we are simply pointing out that this framework 
    is NOT like every other framework. The difference is the way it is written,
    the way red rabbit is structured, the way it runs, the way it installs, its 
    web UI, GUI's and mix of user intefaces along with basic to advanced utilities 
    and commands. Red Rabbit also aims to be authentic which shows that it aims to 
    own its own databases rather than rely on API's or services to connect to just 
    to grab or run simple information that could have been structured by hand. An example 
    of red rabbits authenticity is using its own JSON files / structures to trace / grab 
    information on a phone number based on the numbers dial code and format, not only does 
    this make the tool faster but it also eleminates the need to be online when trying to
    gather information.

    <div class="pstart">
      Conclusions and inspirations
    </div>

    Alot of the reason this project exists is due to the supporters of the project,
    that and people like the authors of BHR/BHG which made this possible by inspiring 
    the devs to make their own tools with certian features and also gave the devs the 
    proper knowledge to do so. Red Rabbit hasnt had a good development history, its first 
    few versions were broken, and the dev did not want to keep going on with the project 
    rather they wanted to just give up and stop doing it. when version .5 got erased 
    and all modifications of version 4 that would have made version 5 were not recoverable 
    the dev took some time off thinking to call it the end of a nightmare but they kept 
    pushing, pushing because of the people that not only supported the dev but supported 
    the project. The dev finnally got to release version 5 then took a good look at it and 
    felt it was half assed, for all the moments that frmework had and the time put behind 
    one single developer just for it to result in a shitty half assed framework, the dev 
    decided to rewrite it thus giving out version 1.0 (current) which is not half assed.
    not only was the entire script re written from scratch but the backups and even the main 
    files got corrupted and lost totalling to 3 tims of having to rewrite version 1.0
    but with the proper strength and the right knowledge from people like the authors of BHG 
    and even developers of payloads like dirty cow the dev was able to rewrite everything 
    not only better but stronger and more efficient each time it was rewritten. The devloper 
    of red rabbit thanks you for supporting the project and hopes to have satisfied you the 
    user and reader of this conlcusion, if there are any improovments you would make to this 
    framework please let the dev know.
