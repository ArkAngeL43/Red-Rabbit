option 1 : Fake Acess point

this will spawn a fake access point using a ruby lib called packet gen note 
you do have to run the script as sudo to do this but first in order to load the
configuration popup

sudo ruby main.rb 

then select option 01 to add a interface called monitor

once done it will prompt you back to the menu, then you can run option 1

option 4 ------------------------

================================== POSSIBLE ERRORS ==========================
-----------------------------------------------
with roge ap sometimes you will get the error 

/var/lib/gems/2.7.0/gems/packetgen-3.2.0/lib/packetgen/pcaprub_wrapper.rb:38:in `activate': unable to activate interface: -8, mon0 (PCAPRUB::PCAPRUBError)

try running 'sudo ruby main.rb' as this part requires root 

if it still can not activate interface do run the file as root then do 01 to start the interface

------------------------------------------------------
whois

sometimes youll get the name server issues where whois can not parse the domain
that is not a script issue it just can not parse it properly 

if you have a weird domain name i suggest you using 

MOAB-OSINT in mneu 3
