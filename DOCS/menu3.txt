------------------------------ Topic : web exploitation 

Warnings: sometimes in the whois file ruby will error out this is because the URl found is false and does not have a registry 

Ajax spider with whois

What lang: Python3
what libs: logging, sys, os, colorama, dattime, threading, pyfiglet, json, webbrowser, urllib, BS4, requests 
what does it do: will go through a URL and web hosts Server and grab every single URL thats possible and traces 
Ajax spider without whois 
same thing as above however it is not as buggy and does silence the whois parsing 


---------------------------------
PHP Injection

Uses: perl, cpan as the installer, LW3, libwhisker, net/http go
langmain: perl 

what does it do: is supposed to inject a PHP vulnerability, howveer this is a very old script handed down from a old team, member of our group, this most likely wont work on 
modern servers or databases even indexes, 

errors: Parsing incorrect, will sometimes freez and not move, will throw eceptions, connection to host is broken, and arguments will break 

----------------------------------
SQL injection
uses: perl
libs: libwhisker, net/http, ANSICOLOR, LW2

what does it do: supposed to inject every single part of a SQL server that is `MySQL v5.x` anything below or above will NOT WORK, like the above code it is a very old script 
that has been ued alot with older servers but will break

errors: Parsing wont work, cant grab the server, connection will break, url test will fail, args get loose, and a few other bugs in the script

----------------------
XSS injection 

uses: python3 
libs: requests, os, threading, sys, time, datetime, colorama, bs4, urllib, 

what does it do: will run through a list of about 3,000+ XSS payloads test every single payload and return all the values 

bugs? there relly arent alot just a warning the formmatting can be very bad
