                  Hello there user of RR5, i wanted to say a few things before you get to finding 
                  your true command and instructions on this tool, i would like to one thank you 
                  and every person so far that has actually landed up in this server or downloading 
                  this script, you guys really do not know how much this project is to me. it took me 
                  5 tries to actually get RR5 up and running due to the amount of shit i went through 
                  when and during the testing of exploits, or os deletion scripts and not saving this File
                  to see so much people care for downloading this script and care to even lookm into it amazes me 
                  while the code is not structured the best i promis yall in later versions this will improove
                  like- ALOT, 

                  i hope this tool helps you on your path, and that it truly does become the program i wanted 
                  people to remember it as, the program that not one fucking person has made before XD ~ ArkAngeL43


                  now througout this documentation you will see code snippets, not all of you will understand it 
                  whatvever i dont care, i mainly created red rabbit as a place all forms of hackers could go 

                  this included starters as much as green hats or advanced hackers as much as a black or white hat 
                  with a OSCP Certification, i want to educate people but also help people out in this field, i may not 
                  generally be the smartest person in this feild but with my current knowlege i can for sure help starters
                  out with understanding the basics, what road and path to get on or in a way how to find your own and 
                  port your own exploits as i have done with dirty cow and my own shells / exploits

                ==============================
                MODULE 1 CHAPTER 1 -> HISTORY|
                ==============================

                [1]  Hello there! anonymous user, i wanted to let you in on what Red-Rabbit (RR) truly is and
                [2] 
                [3]  the true history behind this script, you might have alot of questions like, what led the dev
                [4] 
                [5]  here to write this script single handedly or something like how did this script become a thing 
                [6] 
                [7]  and why ruby or why go as a sub language?
                [9]
                [10] first lets revire what languages this script is written out of 


                [B0] -> Main script    -> Ruby 
                [B1] -> Sub scripts    -> Golang
                [B2] -> Older scripts  -> Perl/Python .2%

                why ruby as a main script or go as a sub language?
                -------------------------------------------------

                well, first before i choose sides let me be honest with you, i always liked Python

                in fact it was one of the very first programming languages i actually learned, however

                over time and coming across languages like R, Fortran, C, Assembly, Perl, or DOS i realized

                that well- there were other languages i could actually choose from that would fit me better 

                thus i stuck first with python and ruby. Ruby is a great language, this is a language that was 

                born to become a hacking language, a language to send and execute exploits extremely fast 

                while also having the readability/writability as python. i chose ruby cause i found it as a very

                very facinating language, one with potential and one that certianly has the weirder syntaxes like 

                my friend perl, #cpan :D. python is a good language but has its limits when it comes to ruby and 

                black hat/ white hat / blue hat / hacking or any other feild out there, it is just over all better.

                i just recently picked up on go and if you go to my github https://github.com/ArkAngeL43 you will see

                that at least 40 scripts are written out of golang, most being injection automation, vulnerability scanning,

                script generation, or hacking in general. why golang though? go is a newer more modern language 

                with one of the better languages for packing malware, sending attacks, readability, writability,

                speed, flexibility and so much more above that it is insane, while go's syntax isnt the best all the 

                features sure make up for that factor. I found golang as a sure held bent passion and even considered 

                re writting red rabbit out of pure assembly and pure golang since you can imbed both C and inline assembly 

                using golang. however i wanted to keep the authenticity of Red Rabbit.


                now lets move on 

                Where did Red rabbit come from? and what is the history behind it
                ------------------------------------------------------------------

                The idea of making my own program that truly was my own and not just 

                a bunch of stollen or copy and pasted code has always been an idea ever

                since i picked up ruby and found out it was a better language for me and 

                for my requirements. when i got into ruby i purchased a book called

                Black Hat Ruby by # KING SABRI | @KINGSABRI who taught some quite amazing 

                ways to execute malicous code using ruby or make basic hacking tools and turn 

                them into advanced scripts that are you're own. The more i read the book the more

                i released and the more i decided to make a framework. on my github page about 70+

                repos down i have a script called Rube-Ster, which was ironically named after my rabbit.

                `https://github.com/ArkAngeL43/Rube-Ster.git`

                I used to have this rabbit named Mrs buttercup, and sometimes it would be this little thing 

                that she would do kinda bounce around randomly, and we called her boopster, the orgin name of 
                
                rubester came from the name `boop ster` however since it was written out of ruby i took the 

                two words and put them together ( rube - ruby ster - boopSTER) = rubester. then she died and 

                i made the contribution by updating the project and calling it red rabbit. keeping its true authenticity

                with writting it in rube, and since rubys are generaly red, thats where the red came from and rabbit 

                well thats obvious.

                NOTE ==> when you want to scan a website go into the scrape.rb file 
                go to where it shows the www.hulu.com as an example replace that 
                with the WWW link of the website, note this is a little buggy the 
                SITE MUST USE IPV4 as this is how it connects and works, working 
                on finding a library. or i might recreate in rust 


                ______________________ABOUT___________________________
                well for one let m,e introduce you to Rube-rabbit
                or rubster as i like to call this framework, well  
                Rube-Rabbit is a penetration testing scanner and recon
                framework written mainly from ruby. with ruby being its 
                base it is a very fast fra,ework for port scanning or
                arp scanning the local area network (LAN). i honetsly
                built this framework to see what i could do with ruby 
                there are wya more things to come, and way more options
                coming and even being built in rube-rabbit. in the future
                there will come to be more scripts for scanning, attacking, 
                and maybe even some extra tweaks here and there 



                _________________NEWS/TIPS_____________________________
                Rube-Rabbit or Rubester is a very brand new pentesting 
                and ethical hacking framework meaning it is still 
                in beta and currently under development. no there
                isnt many issues or even issues ive come across so 
                far. however there are some things that make this 
                script a little bit sucky, if you want to scan a website 
                you are going to have to go into the scrape.rb ruby file
                and enter the www. websites. and the website must support
                IPAV4 (internet protocal version 4) as from my own tests
                websites with IPAV6 connections are not supported using 
                the current library, further on i will search for any 
                repos or libs i can use to port scan websites with 
                IPAV6 socks and IPV4 socks.

                Command ARP
                this is a ARP tool written in golang that well- just doesnt stop arping, this is a very lightweight 
                fast but nice arp scanner that is quite accurate as well, while not being able to identify devices it stores 
                all data in a list called out.txt which is all the IP addresses that came back as true and mac addresses
                when you run this command in the terminal there is an error that can occure 
                ```
                you do not have premissions to capture or send on this device
                ```
                this means you are not root, please do run your terminal as admin or run as root user ex sudo ruby main.rb
                when you run the command `ARP` or lower case `arp`
                you will get the following output

                ```
                lets first break this down by starting with the file loaded output, the file loaded output at the top is both the input and output file 
                this script works by saving the addresses in one file, copying and then finally moving to in.txt where everything is properly saved 
                we run the program and you will notice the directory modules/wifi will now have three files
                one for port scanning 
                one for general IP 
                one for MAC addresses and IP's laced together
                in.txt -> is where the geneal MAC AND IP's are inputted
                out.txt -> is where the general MAC and IP's are saved
                lace_ip.txt -> is where the IP addresses with no general strings are stored for listed port scanning in the option port-gl which allows
                golang listed port scanning for quicker and more responsive recon
                lets now talk about the stat and interface load before the arp starts 
                the [INTERFACE] tag specified that the interfaces and arp module has been loaded, this will gather all of your 
                interface informatiopn IP6-IP4 and tell you what will be used and if there is a err on the network card obviously 
                the tag ip=range=6 will not be there as that is just a placeholder for my example network addresses as the real output 
                will show ranges of IP6-4 addresses like this 
                ```
                2021/12/24 10:12:40 [INTERFACE] ->  wlan2 0.0.0.0/98
                2021/12/24 10:12:40 [INTERFACE] ->  wlan2 ffff:ffff:fff:ff:fff:ffff:ffff/90

                ```
                you sometimes will get the warning message 
                SKIPPING LO, this means it will not use the loopback interface as a way to send out ARP requests and will instead skip onto the next card 
                sometimes you will also recieve this error ( despite the ARP still conitnueing on)
                ```
                MASK TO LARGE this means that 
                if your interface addr.Mask[0] != 0xff || addr.Mask[1] != 0xff
                then it will become to large for it to range from 
                ```
                other warning messages can occure such as 
                Unstable Network on card
                this will mean that
                the address on that card side came back nil/null/empty and it is considered unstable as a network, however this will not cause a major issue 
                it just simply means the program wasnt able to identify it properly
                once we are done we can now look at the terminal to see everything it picked up 
                ````
                $ example output 
                IP-ADDR =>   ip4 Has MAC ADDR of =>    ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

                ** NOTE: SOME ADDRESSES WILL REPEAT THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT IT CONSTANTLZY SENDS OUT ARP REUQESTS AND LISTENS FOR A CTRL+C HANGUP **
                ** EXPECT SOME HOSTNAMES TO HAVE THE SAME MAC ADDRESS AND THE SAME IP THIS IS ONLY BCEAUSE OF RE LOOP AND SCANNING                **
                once you think you are finished arping and you are confident the scanner has fully scanned the network, then press CTRL+C which will exit the program
                when we are completely out of the program we can run the following command to view all the information saved to the files 

                ````
                cat modules/out.txt ; cat modules/lace_ip.txt

                ````
                which will again give us all captured information

            MODULE 3 -> CHAPTER 2 ( ajax spiders)


            in this script i have three types of ajax spiders ( all written in golang )

            first lets go over the command and beif description 

            |-> ajax-wo | Ajax spider without whois for every url scanned                           
            |-> ajax-NK | Ajax spider NUCLEAR aka a over powered crawler                           
            |-> ajax-wu | Ajax spider with whois for every url scanned  

            what is the difference between a ajax spider without whois and a ajax with WHOIS 

            first lets go over what these spiders do, spiders are just simple plain web crawlers asides these are not 

            the average web crawler they work a little bit differently- well the first option we have here ajax-wo

            is the more simple plain ajax spider that doesnt dig every single url it finds and rather does a basic 

            crawl and investigation on the URL, get the base request headers, find the server, doamin, and IP of

            every url it found and write it to a file called ip-out, out.txt etc a basic output will look like this

            ````

            as you can see it found the URl, response, request headers, response headers, server status, domain, and even out put 

            the amount of bytes of data written to the file


            lets now look at the most over powered command of them all and that is ajax-NK i will have everyone note this is A VERY 

            UNSTABLE AND ILLEGAL SCRIPT, this goes above and beyond in terms of testing. the features it has are 

            getting the following information 
            =================================

            server, server name, server date, request headers, whois, IP6, IP4, Every URl, The HTML files, download every HTML file,

            admin URLs, SQL urls, the title, the domain name, the domain dig, the domain response, the tracker, and if the URl comes 

            across as dangerous it attempt to redirect it through the loopback and make a non private connection to the host blocking the 

            host from accessing your data or PC or even browser. 

            lets go over what it does upon entering data 



            first we need to look at the required input red rabbit gives us for the basic parsing

            when we first choose the option ajax-nk, we are prompted to the following required inputs 

            HTTPS-URL >
            DOMAIN    >
            BASE-HTTP >

            we know the basic strings, https url, domain etc but what is the base http?

            the bas http is just another term for a http url like this http://www.google.com is a base http url

            when we enter that data we are prompted for a question

            ```
            for every url the spider finds, would you like to download the HTML page?
            ```

            *************** WARNING ************************
            * this WILL TAKE UP ALOT OF MEMORY AND SPACE   *
            ************************************************
            if you select yes then it will continue onto scraping 

            lets now look at an example output used 


            first we see the most common given that being 

            ```

            ```

            this gets the target IP, and sees if you have any URL's in your notepad/copy pad

            then we get the stat 

            ```

            the top in frgaments and what not parses extreme urls an exmaple is 

            https://www.google.com/index.php/id=1./as/diosrgdruoghedrogoedurgweffij4803895u34ID4wr3rID=13344FopR3-4-4-4-etctetctetctdt

            which will give everything on that basic URL in itself


            then we go to the base targeting, it will attempt to search for over 400+ admin panel URL's and parse it 


            an example as the folloqwing output will be shown 


            ```

            Title of the page:   example domain  
            64

            ```

            lets walk through this output, first you have the found domain name this is the parsed domain 

            it will parse the domain into my own module i wrote for port scanning and port scan the domain 

            then get the IP6-IP4, server, host, and status following that attempt to SQL inject the host 20+ times

            and finally get the host information or the response/GET headers of the URL



            if you added the option yes of downloading all the html files in range of every url you might see something 

            like this 

            ```
            AEu7_dybyUFcbpvlbmV4HPzL0wIPOApjwsE.html
            ```

            this is the HTMl of EACH URL's HTML file you downloaded

            it works like this 


            go code 

            ````
            var chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890-"

            func shortID(length int) string {
                ll := len(chars)
                b := make([]byte, length)
                rand.Read(b)
                for i := 0; i < length; i++ {
                    b[i] = chars[int(b[i])%ll]
                }
                return string(b)
            }

            ````

            this generates a random string, and applys it to a definition that is called in the go code under a for

            urls found in base url then name the file string(rune)filenamestring etc

            the output for the nuclear ajax is stored in

            Command => eth-sniff


            Defualt => Listen for specific network packet response types like IP, TCP, HTTPS, etc 


            what is this? 

            This is probobly one of the more larger go scripts i have that RR5 runs, it is a very simple 

            but user friendly programs, and easy to explain. this is a very simple Packet capture analysis 

            command line application meant to capture certian packets through a filter, there is alot to this 

            tool so let me break it down first by arguments needed when running the proper commmand 

            when we execute the command `eth-sniff`

            we will be prompted to input a Interface, BPF, and a type of packet to listen for 

            here is an example of my information 


            i want to listen on interface ETH0, for IP packets, with the Berkly Packet Filter set to 443

            when i impliment the information into the inputs RR5 asks me for then you will be redirected 

            to the following example output

            [ETHER_RABBIT] DATA:   18:10:31   LISTENING USING BPF STD FILTER ->  443


            the first thing you notice is going to be the table data, this shows us the following user data 

            If user is root 
            does it need root 
            our interface we are listening on 
            the filepath of the script 
            the capture filter 
            and the Berkly Packet Filter (BPF) 

            this is all simple to understand, given this tool isnt as nearly close as fast as wireshark 
            we can still see some decent formatted data, an example is here i captured a IP packet

            ````

            lets break this down, first we have ETHER RABBIT information which is pointing its a dynamic chain 

            and telling us the source ip address is 10.0.0.1 and the destination address is 244.0.0.1

            _10.0.0.0_----_0.0.0.0_ 
            | SrcIP         | DstIP


            then we get details about the ETH/IP packet 

            IP-Protocal |=>  ICMPv4
            Length      |=>  36
            IP-ID       |=>  62364
            IP-Flags    |=>  
            Frag-Offset |=>  0
            TTL         |=>  1
            Checksum    |=>  56186
            IHL         |=>  5
            Version     |=>  4


            the IP protocal is Internet Protocal version 4
            the length of the message was 36 bytes
            the IP packet ID is 62364
            the fragmentation offset was 0
            the TTL was 1
            the checksum was 56186
            the IHL was 5
            and the version of the IPADDR was IPv4



            here is another example, this time i wanted to listen for ALL forms of layers that 

            are supported in this script

            so when it prompts us for a filter we will skip it and just press enter

            when we let the program run for a few seconds sometimes it can be up to a minute 

            we can instantly get the following

            as you can see here we first get the WARN < WARN: FLag.EMPTY NILL > which indicated in RR5

            We skipped the input for packet filtering / specific listening such as TCP, IP, SYN....etc

            we can also tell wether or not we filled the flag by the table, if the Capture filter 

            != ( does not = ) tcp, ip, application, eth then it will come out with a msg saying

            ```
            Defualt Capture ALL
            ```

            if you wanted to you can also use the tool i made ether shark ( the net capture ) to dump 

            .pcapng files, which then in uses the command < dump-pcap > which all we do is input the path to 

            the file and get an output similar to below

            ************************
            Command > d-g
            
            this command is quite similar to whois accept it takes in URL's
            
            this will just render the information of a url such as 
            
            fragments, parsed URLs, domain, html info, etc etc 
            
            
            ************************
            Command => F-dns
            
            Forward DNS lookup 
            
            when option is made you will be prompted to a input asking for a DNS this will be say something 
            
            like twitter or google then put 
            
            google.com 
            
            then it will return an array of IP addresses to that specified domain something like this 
            
            ```
            ["21.81.158.122", "102.40.90.182", "192.168.9.34"]
            ```
            
            ***********************
            command => r-dns 
            
            similar to fdns but reverse this will be Reverse DNS lookup ( IP to hostname )
            
            same like f-dns you are prompted to input a IP
            
            say we input something like 21.81.158.122
            
            then we will get a result similar to twitter or if a PTR is assigned it will return an array
            
            ***********************
            Command => URL-r 
            
            
            this will be kinda like a whois for URL's accept once finding the domain 
            
            attempt to port scan it, find parsed queries and fragements of the URL, take and scan for 
            
            vulnerabilities then get you request headers and what not here is a sample output

            port scanning host.....
            
            < whatever ports return open >
            
            THIS MUST BE A COMPLEX URL IT CAN NOT BE A BASIC URL 
            
            URL should look something like this 
            
            https://www.amazon.com/s?k=hello&crid=3STVACWU9JYET&sprefix=hello%2Caps%2C93&ref=nb_sb_noss_2
            
            
            
            
            **************************
            Command => HTML-r
            
            HTML-r is similar to every single bit of the URL-r
            
            accept it grabs information specified in the HTML such as 
            
            URL query paramaters, fragments of a URL, domain, urls in the HTML, HTML Code notes 
            
            HTML queries, HTML tags, Most USED tags in HTML, then getting Query values, etc 
            
            a sample output would look like one above without the http response time
            
            
            
            ***********************
            Command => GDA 
            
            GDA = Google dork domain 
            
            this is as well the name states, google dork a domain name with bash and get the results 
            
            when running this commnad you are prompted to input a url
            
            lets say something like https://www.vulnbedasp.com
            
            then we will get something like 
            
            https://www.google.com/vulnweb.php
            along with some others that can work with it
            
            ***********************
            command => p-r
            
            i think we all know what time it is ;) thats time for parrot pentest automation
            
            this will just run parrot recon a script me ( ArkAngeL43 ) and (parrotassassin15 ) built to 
            automate recon with bash and many other tools among that, it will ask for a url, domain, and ip in case 
            
            the output is to large to show however it will run tools like sublister, go crawl, go-dork, google dorker,
            
            phinx, nmap, nicto, and some other really powerful and fast tools to make recon even better for somneone who just 
            
            wants to input a URL leave it for an hour or two then come back with a terminal filled of tastey treasure

            Chapter 2: BSSID/SSID scouting
            ------------------------------
            
            as i have explained before the wireless part of this project was quite long 
            
            however good news for you is this means the documentation will be long and in detail :D
            
            
            so first, in RR5 there are 3 commands for SSID/BSSID scouting 
            
            G-BSSID 
            W-SSID 
            
            
            now you may be asking wtf is the diffrence truth is the language barrier, for those reading who do keep a long tab both in 
            
            my discord server, on my instaram, or even on my github know that i have been trying as hard as possible to deprecate perl
            
            c, assembly, and the worst of all python. so to replace all of those languages and annoying installs i decided to use golang 
            
            a great, fast, easy to use, writeable and descriptive language overall. however for some tools like the wireless tools i had 
            
            to still keep python instead of ruby, i have found that the python run give more information and runs possibly the best than all 3 
            
            
            first lets go through the golang file 
            
            
            what are the pros and cons about this one? ( g-bssid )
            ===========================================
            
            
            pros : it writes to a file, it is fast, it changes channels and shows the channel of each BSSID it caught, it logs errors 
            
            and it activates your interface 
            
            
            cons : it can end up repeating BSSID's it already discovered given its under a for loop, data is sparse and not in much details
            
            
            simply we run this command 
            
            G-BSSID to activate the script and tool you will get the something like the following example output

            and it will appear and disappear, you will also notice in the filepath 
            
            modules/wifi the files ion/out.txt appear, this has the same concept for one of the 
            
            network recon scripts, the in/out file stores the BSSID, however the con about this is sometimes 
            
            this file can have repeated BSSID's which isnt too bad of a thing but too a new user not seeing any form 
            
            of SSID or ID it can get quite confusing 
            
            here is a tip 
            
            
            look out for the last two or first integers of the bssid, if it repeats twice then it was repeated and is the same
            
            
            
            what are the pros and cons about the W-SSID ( the python one )
            ============================================
            
            
            pros : well for one it has a way more neater output, it tables the output, it changes channels, it has a SSID finder.
            
            it shows the time elapsed, it gets the encryption level etc 
            
            
            cons : it doesnt write to a file, some SSID's dont show up, sometimes the wireless interface wont work, 
            
            sometimes the SSID will be hidden and show 0 output.
            
            
            
            lets talk about this in way more depth, we will run the command W-SSID and we will be prompted to anser the following 
            
            what card you want to activate ( please activate your interface before hand and in the input type interfacename with mon0 at the end 
            
            example wlan0mon
            )
            
            this is because the input is a little glitchy and just is wacky. anyway the output will look something like this

                lets role over the very first command, it is as simple as it sounds 

                whois = a simple whois name server parser written for red rabbit in pure ruby 

                we execute this by typing 

                `whois`

                in the input feild in RR5

                you will be prompted to input a domain name DO NOT USE www AS A DOMAIN NAME

                the following error will occure

                ```
                Traceback (most recent call last):

                THE WHOIS AND WHOIS-PARSER WILL NOT TAKE WWW URLS 

                every URL will have a simple domain name which can be resoluted as something like this 

                google.com, nasa.gov, education.edu, twitter.com etc 

                url stays the same, the following output will occure

                we get the basic information as we would the ajax spiders but a bit more tracer- kinda 

                as you can seee you get DNS queries and records as well as answeres of the bytes being sent and data 

                that was sent to the domain name you input

                   in RR5 i have a command set named dm-b which stands for domain blocker, this takes a file 
                   
                   of hosts ex: www.example.com and attempts to block them and loop the conections through your 
                   
                   loopback to make it sure that this website can not access your computer, while also blocking 
                   
                   you from accessing it as well
                   
                   
                   i imagine this one can be quite confusing but in the RR5 main file there is a file labeled 
                   
                   config-files, this is the configuration file path for every single tool that needs a configuration file
                   
                   in that filepath there is a file labeled `blacklist.txt` this is the file where you will store 
                   
                   all the hostnames you want to block `note only websites can be written as of now, currently adding support`
                   
                   lets say i wanted to block the website `www.scanme.org` from my computer and not allow myself to make a connection 
                   
                   between my pc and the server on the other side 
                   
                   i would simply edit this txt file with the name 
                   
                   
                   ````
                   www.scanme.com 
                   ````
                   
                   save it then run RR5 followed by the command dm-b
                   
                   ** NOTE: you can use your own filepath, this is just an easier in for the tool and instead of making 
                   
                     or creating your own its best to have it pre setup **
                   
                   
                   lets make an example for further inspection of how this works without confusion 
                   
                   so i have my home directory and in that dir rr5 lays here is what i will input when the script asks me for a filepath
                   
                   
                   /home/user/RR5/config-files/blacklist.txt
                   
                   it prevents the error 
                   
                   
                   ````
                   2021/12/25 19:55:17 open config-files/blacklist.txt: no such file or directory
                   ````
                   
                   despite you being in the RR5 filepath dring execution, simply cause each tool is stored in its own topic 
                   
                   and filepath which can not be opened if the script has it names /modules when the filepath is /config if you 
                   
                   generally get what i am saying it is easier to work around this.

                    answer yes because cpan is a very VERY old workspace and compiler for perl
                    
                    imagine setting up fortran95 thats how annoying perl both is to write and setup 
                    
                    with advanced and manual configuration

                    PERL MODULE LW2 INSTALLS |
                    =========================|
                    
                    To install modules, you need to configure a local Perl library directory or
                    escalate your privileges.  CPAN can help you by bootstrapping the local::lib
                    module or by configuring itself to use 'sudo' (if available).  You may also
                    resolve this problem manually if you need to customize your setup.
                    
                    What approach do you want?  (Choose 'local::lib', 'sudo' or 'manual')
                     [local::lib] 
                    
                    DO CHOOSE SUDO AS THIS IS THE BEST WAY FOR CPAN TO WORK AROUND WHEN RUNNING WITH 
                    
                    THIRD PARTY MODULES SUCH AS LW2
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    thats it installs should be done 
                    
                    everything shouold install just fine by the time you are done run the script 
                    
                    AS SUDO PLEASEEE it works better, like a shit ton better than you think, especially
                    
                    with fake access points.

                    Module 2.9 chapter 1 | Root/Unroot Installing
                    
                    ***************************************************************
                    
                    alright lets get one thing fucking straight, i think there is something that seems 
                    
                    to always boggle peoples minds and confuse them, that is alaways installing a script 
                    
                    on linux most times this can be annoying especially if the script needs root access 
                    
                    luckily for you ive made this a shit ton easier than you're brain can comprehend
                    
                    
                    i have made two .sh .bash files in the installs directory 
                    
                    one labled root.sh
                    
                    and another labeled basic.sh
                    
                    
                    cd into the directory and chmod +x both of those files 
                    
                    run basic.sh without sudo and then rub root.sh with root 
                    
                    
                    since this script was annyoing on the wireless side, i will say that well-
                    
                    sometimes making the script access wireless interfaces needs to be run as sudo
                    
                    so when you run the script as sudo and only installed via PID -0 then well- 
                    
                    you will have to go through the entire configuration setup again via sudo for nothing 
                    
                    so these two files make it alot easier to do installs both root and un root 
                    
                    
                    boom i just saved you 12 days

                    languages used
                    ====================
                    
                    as you all may know red rabbit has been a very per say diverse project in terms of the used amount 
                    
                    of programming languages, in version 4 alone we used 10+ programming languages for no reason, however
                    
                    in version 5 there has been ALOT of that removed, all c/asm was built into the go files, all of the python 
                    
                    scripts were deprecated and re made in golang or ruby, all osint scripts were transformed into go and improoved
                    
                    and as goes for the perl scripts, those sadly had to stay, it is not a main choice if anything it is suggested 
                    
                    not to use the perl scripts asides the DOS in perl, as it becomes- very annoying and confusing to anyone but 
                    
                    the og developers of the scripts. or people who have used them and understand the code behind it.
                    
                    even upon writing documentation it was just very different to explain. however 
                    
                    RR5 ( Red Rabbit Version 5 ) is written from ruby, as well as has networking modules out of ruby 
                    
                    but in order to sustain Red rabbit's unique ness, we decided it was best to re write most of the scripts 
                    
                    in Golang, as go is a neat language and one of the easier ones but faster languages out there, with great runtime 
                    
                    and more control over erros and issues in the script, such as passing arguments and checking for boolean return values
                    
                    in the error statements.
                    
                    
                    
                    this script is written from about 58% ruby, and the rest being go and perl

                    This command pillages a filesystem using regex to search for a certian topic when you run the command you will be prompted with 
                    
                    RR5> fp-pillage
                     EX: Admin, Name, hashes, passwords etc
                    Enter a REGEX name > 
                    
                    the regex name refers to the string you want regex to search for, say we have a filesystem we need to search that is large 
                    
                    this consists of the root filesystem but we want to find ALL files with the name admin we will use 
                    
                    admin as a string argument to the input box, then we are asked to input a filepath to searh in this case 
                    
                    we will search the root filesystem
                    
                    once down filling out the filpath we instantly get a major scroll of all the filepaths found thast uses the word `admin`

this command is 

xss-t

when you input the url it will ask for a payload file, if you do not have one to remember or have

a very specified path for it then just type xss.txt as this is the most defualt wordlist for this script 

the following output will come out on the terminal 

( this part works with golang as a primary source for socket name manipulation)

this usually will mean that it came back false and does not come back as correct

however if the URL is vulnerable it will tabulate the output in  green as that is how you know the 

url is known and or vulnerable to XSS injection

 when you run the command you are asked for the following, the domain name and a wordlist 
 
 in this case the domain i will be searching will be microsoft.com
 
 now our name list should look like this 
 
 --------

 academico
 acceso
 access
 accounting
 accounts
 acid
 activestat
 ad
 adam

 admin
 administracion

 --------------
 
 this will determin the sub domains we are looking for, when done parsing the wordlist we will be prompted for 
 the defualt workers to run this process, this determins how fast the program should run, the higher the number the more workers the faster
 but heavier it gets, an example is 1000 which is what my machine can handel 
 
 the last and final bit of information is the DNS server we will use, this will be what the domains will be targgeted with, in this case 
 lets use googles IP of their server which is 8.8.8.8 on port 53
 
 8.8.8.8:53 
 
 you can also skip this method by hitting enter, when we are done inputting all the information we will get the following output

 first lets go over the table output, the first header shows the filename where the data was saved to 
 
 the second row is the domain we are targeting 
 
 the third row shows the domain server 
 
 then the fourth shows the go routines/threads being spawned and or working, if you have all your domains correct the 
 output will look a little like this

  HOST ~~~> agent.micdgdgdgrosoft.com            IP ADDR OF HOST ~~~> 134.brokrsgdfghjd188.221
  HOST ~~~> awww.misfgfgdfrosoft.com               IP ADDR OF HOST ~~~> 40.11dmghdhgd205
 
 first we have the host domain that was pulled then the IP address of that domain name

                    I am going to start off this module by saying, Red Rabbit as said at the very top of the documentation is a project to help security grow bigger 
                    
                    and to help learning pentesters or hackers understand how some tools work on the backend and despite this tool being used for alot of anti security missions 
                    
                    it still is in development and not everything will be its best, however it doesnt mean this tool can not be enjoyable. i hope so far the user of this script 
                    
                    is actually enjoying this, and is learning alot from eaither the documentation or using the script.
                    
                    
                    Without further to do lets go 
                    
                    
                    
                    let us start out with the very basic of them all and that is the TCP dumper written in ruby 
                    
                    this is just a simple command but lets go through the output so it makes it easier to understand 
                    
                    first lets get the terms down 
                    
                    
                    :connections => This is the incoming connection that was captured 
                    :source      => This is the source of the packet 
                    :destination => This is the destination address of the packet
                    :count       => This is the count of the packets that came through
                    
                    
                    lets run the command 
                    
                    the command for this is 
                    
                    `
                    tcp-d
                    `
                    
                    when we enter the command we will be prompted to answer the following, and that is what port we 
                    
                    would like to capture incoming network traffick on, that being this will be 443 in this example 
                    
                    here is the very first example output we are greeted with

                    {:connections=>[{:source=>"140.82.114.25", :destination=>"1.0.0.1", :count=>1}, {:source=>"162.159.134.234", :destination=>"192.168.9.01", :count=>1}, {:source=>"192.168.9.01", :destination=>"162.159.134.234", :count=>1}], :count=>3, :uniq=>3}
                    
                    
                    ````
                    
                    lets break this down 
                    
                    first we have our date and base infromation, what the source was and how much packets we have captured
                    
                    ```
                    [09:03 AM][ INFO ] Packets captured => 2
                    
                    [09:03 AM][ INFO ]
                    {:source=>"162.159.134.234"}
                    
                    
                    ```
                    
                    simple information and now we get into the split array the packet sniffer gave us
                    
                    
                    ```
                    {:connections=>[{:source=>"140.82.114.25", :destination=>"1.0.0.1", :count=>1}, {:source=>"162.159.134.234", :destination=>"192.168.9.01", :count=>1}, 
                    {:source=>"192.168.9.01", :destination=>"162.159.134.234", :count=>1}], :count=>3, :uniq=>3}
                    ```
                    
                    we can see that there was a connection made by the source 140.82.114.25 and its destination was reaching to the IPV4 1.0.0.1 and the packet count is 1
                    
                    
                    as said above there really is not much to this command as its a light simple TCP listener

                    Command's => FTP-C, ftp-read
                    
                    
                    base of two commands 
                    
                    FTP-C => FTP credential sniffer 
                    
                    ftp-read => Open and read pcap files for credentials 
                    
                    it really doesnt go any deeper 
                    
                    when we input FTP-C you will geta  message that it is listening on the basic FTP port and is awaiting the capture 
                    
                    this will grab and sniff credentials being used to access a FTP server over the same local network, this is quite again simple 
                    
                    it is also the same with the command `ftp-read` accept with files, when you run the command you are prompted for a file 
                    
                    there is a pcapng file in `captures-test` named ftp-captured.pcapng which holds an example of FTP credentials being sniffed 
                    
                    when you input the file it will search that entire file for FTP credentials and you will receive the following output
                    
                    
                    ```

                Command => fake-ap

                this was aactually one of the more difficult ones, first i had alot of issues with errors 

                where strings wouldnt pqarse, names wouldnt go right etc, keep in mind the code i used was in 

                the end writen when packetgen first came out and i tried the best i could to modify it and make it

                into a module, dont expect the best out of it. but the simple idea of this command is to just show 

                the general idea of penetration testing. now what does it do, well for starters it sends out fake access 

                points using packetgen, this isnt nothing as said above special where you can connect, or monitor connections.

                but it can be a little `scare` XD if you must say 

                going forward you must run RR5 as a root script this is because the interface will be opened and used which will 

                usually almost 100% of the time need root access to do so, your interface will also need to be in monitor mode 

                see command

                ```
                ch5 interfaces 
                ```

                in the interactive web documentation for RR5 for more detials on using RR5 to set 

                your interfcae in monitor mode or doing it individually without RR5


                when we execute the command we are brought to input out interface 

                mine is wlan0mon

                and then the name of the FAKE AP we will be setting up, this is suggested to be above 5 characters

                and nothing less cause then it messes with the output `note: leave it empty and script will exit`

                my SSID's name is kingforlary

                now alot of people will be confused about this last part here which asks for a packet view 

                the packet view is going to be wether or not you want to see the packets structure, for the case 

                of breakdown and documentation im going to select yes or Y and hit enter 

                when we do we are brought to the following output

                first we can see we are brought down the the banner and the structure of the packet/header 

                this will give us general information, the one think we can tell it worked is if one 

                we have 0 errors and second the array of elements matches what we inputted


                ````
                    ArrayOfElements         elements: type:SSID,length:11,value:"kingforlary"
                ````

                we can also see the extra information i put below


                breaking it down the Beacon Type is the type of beacon you are sending wether its real or fake 

                then the SSID name is well the name you inputted 

                the interface is the interface obviously being used 

                the beacons sent is a constant records of how much beacons are sent

                    pheonix servers, well you may be asking what is this? phoenix servers is basically a 

                    secondary host written out of Golang, R, and PostGreSQL that will host localhost servers 

                    web interfaces, and more. this was a personal project for me. a little back story here for you\


                    over time i started hating platforms, this was because of how truly vulnerable every single 

                    one was, so in order to trust my passwords are safe where i can both modify and change them 

                    all through a simple automatoion process, i built my own database built using GOlang and PostGreSQL

                    this was first a command line interface only tool, could not be modified, it was a few thousand lines 

                    and the data was hard coded into the script, meaning you had to manually create the SQL files and change the 

                    data to re insert values. it wasnt up until december i decided to remake everything out of Golang, C, asm, R, 

                    HTML/CSS/SCSS PostGreSQL, and SQL to where you can not only insert new data, but delete and drop tables 

                    this database isnt like any other, its advanced go code and very very safe standards for hashing make it 

                    a pretty script in itself, i honestly do not touch much pride in my work ( pun intended touch ) but, when it 

                    comes to scripts like RR5 and Pheonix-DB/Servers i do take alot of pride in those.


                    you may be asking me couldnt someone just hack into your network and log onto the server?


                    truth about that is it only starts when my machine runs, and the machine it runs on is pure CLI SSH

                    i have two passwords one for root which remains of a 15 character password, one for my SSH, then when you 

                    launch the CLI it is sent over or the disp is exported to my main machine, when you enter or log onto the local 

                    host port, you will automatically get a message that a user has logged in or not logged in yet but accessed the 

                    local host server, once done you must enter a 16 key hash that is randomly generated and sent to a personal what 

                    i like to call `data dumping` server, every time the script start, that random password is written and known by the server 

                    for the next login, so when you execute a command you will also need that randomly generated password to access those tables 

                    ( some i made you had to be root to access them as well )

                    the topology of the server is kinda weird, but it made me feel 100000% safer than what say someting like google does 


                    i always went by the general idea if you can create it more secure or better do it, so i did. im not saying 

                    my server is unhackable cause nothing is, however when a person has control over their data it makes it alot 

                    more safer and secure from cyber attacks. speaking on hashing and passwords this is a simple 

                    demo of what my hashing topology looks like for the server `pheonix servers`


                    ````

                    Password randomyl generated -> Hashed -> reverse the hash -> generate a hash based off that reversed hash|
                                                                                                                            |
                                                            Send to the discord server  <=  Reverse the reverse reversed hash|
                    ````

                    pretty intriguing right? anyway thats the small breif history of pheonix servers 

                    there is no company or brand name its kinda just a name i made for it given the effort and thought put into it

                lets work on the hardest script and the longest process in RR5 this is 

                SSH-possession with SSH-sploit

                keep in mind i tried to make this as obvious and easy to use as possible 

                Virus sploit is built into ruby and uses pure ruby code to connect and send commands 

                over SSH, ofc this isnt going to be a direct console to the host this is rather 

                just a small script to send viruses and brute force the SSH or attempt to execute it 

                ** WARNING: THE VIRUSES USED TO SEND TO THE VCTIMS MACHINE ARE DANGEROUS DO NOT EXECUTE 
                THEM WHILE IN SSH SPLOIT, DO IT IN A SSH CONSOLE!!!!

                YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
                ** 

                how do you properly run RR5 with SSh sploit 

                RR5 has built in 3 command line arguments that can be taken for SSH sploit this will 

                be run as an example, i have my rasberry pi setup with an ssh port on a class 3 IP address 

                of 10.0.0.90, with password123, and the name is pi 

                so I want to use SSH sploit in ruby to well obviously attack my rpi so i run rr5 as the following 

                you will not be given any message or desktop notification 

                we will be prompted to the RR5 terminal, all we input now is 

                SSH-p | Command to initate SSH possession

                you will be loaded to the following 

                ````
                device name =>          | This is the device name mine is pi
                hostname    =>          | This is the IPA of the rpi
                password    =>          | This is the password to the device's SSH 

                ````

                once done you are prompted to the following


                ``````````

                then we will go ahead and ask for HELP which can be typed lower or upper as 

                HELP || help both work

                you get the following

              This is a table of all of the paramaters that are vulnerable to SQL injection 
              or the one we will attack, in this demonstration im going to use the ID param 
              as that will be the only one my target is vulnerable to 
              
              when we enter the Paramater we want to attack we will get the following output

              Now note that this tool is very very slow and has some major improovements heading 
              its way, and it is still in development, as of Red Rabbit version 5.5 i plan to actually 
              standardize and customize the tool a fuck ton more, and give it a better ability to actually 
              get the contents of every MySQL DB and table and columns etc via tor and proxies
              
              there isnt much to this tool other than grabbing the tables and the DB name
              sometimes i have found when SQLMAP wont connect to the target it has come handy
              so maybe this could be useful :D

            Command type   => QR=nolist 
            Command type 2 => QR=list

            These two commands are similar accept one accepts a list and the other does not 

            these commands allow you to both mass generate QR codes EXTREMELY fast while also 
            gathering the EXIF data and embed URL's inside of the QR Code


            The first command is command type QR=nolist this takes a URL as an accepting argument 
            now given RR5 is a very per say diverse script using many languages i didnt want to just 
            single out perl and use rust, my inital plan for RR5 was to elimnate over 90% of the languages 
            that were in here that could easily be written in another language that i knew such as 
            in this example perl, this script is written out of Perl 5.10.0 as its brother is written in 
            RAKU ( perl 6.0.0), to chomp down the main languages i re wrote alot of my personal scripts as well 
            as the ones in RR5 using perl. ( sorry had to clear that up)


            anyway, when you ru n the command type #1 QR=nolist then you will be 
            prompted to follow or input a URL, just input a random one of a malicous one 
            if you want, this works with ANY links, it could be google, malware, youtube, or a ip logger
            fuck even a fishing page if you'd like

            once you are done you get the following output

            okay woah pretty large output, lets break this down

            first i would like to let you know the table is ALOT more formatted via 
            terminal,. just didnt work as so with the html XD

            Firs we see the following output


            #########################################
            Testing URL ~~> https://www.google.com
            #########################################

            [ INFO ]  Chcking if main.png exists 

            [ INFO ]  File main.png exists 


            this will be the most noticeable because it blinks and it annoys you 
            ( PS: thats the point)

            anyway it will first test the URL if it is both real, matches with REGEX
            and response with a code of 200, if it does then it will keep going, then 
            in the script i have a defualt barcode name which will be 
            main.png

            if this exists it will generate a new one

                [ INFO ] WARNING: NEW STRING NAME => EDA295F7.png

            this one here, this will be the PNG BARCODE that was generated for you


            the table is a bunch of EXIF data about the barcode to tell you 
            the type of file, the format, the size the general data and if you 
            can see the EMBEDDED URL when you hex dump it or view its OFFSET


            then at the end you get the DIR


            Dir of QR code is modules/perl/modules/QR-GEN/main.png



            ---

            Fucking finally we can move on to the listed file technique

            this one will generate barcodes EXTREMELY FAST, so the output 
            WILL BE MESSY, you have been warned

            when you run the command type # 2 aka 

            QR=list


            then you will be asked for a file of URL's
            take our file as an example

            ..... a whole bunch of random GOOGLE links totalling 100+ URLS

            now i dont like to say my scripts are fast but to process this 
            amount of URLS, inject them into barcodes, change and generate names of barcodes 
            save the output, hex dump it, format the data into a table, and test the hex string, 
            ip string, desig string etc etc etc is pretyy fucking fast, i tested this on a file of 
            1000+ urls and hosts it generated 1000+ barcodes in under a few seconds XDDDD it toom 4.5 seconds 
            maybe thats my system but shit thats fast 

            anyway when we throw the path of URLS into the name we will get the output as the following

            WOAH WOAH WOAH TIGER CHILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL 

            i gotta dig the fuck deep into this before you get confused 
            fuck im a developer of this script i literally made this from 
            scratch and i get confused XD

            okay well, first we see the standard banner and tables

            and some output bugs


            okay so the first thing i am going to explain will be the difference 
            in the output, sometimes it will generate URL's and PNG's so fast it 
            really wont be able to 100% test them ( but its affective in generation )

            as you can see in the first row it gave the warning that the URL could 
            not be tested or was requested so fast the server gave the request an error

            now after that a unqie thing i like about the way i designed it is you 
            can tell what URL has what PNG, these are all randomly generated and can not 
            be parsed with the URL name since forematting wouldnt work since i formatted 
            the data output and input as the following

            my @cols = qw/Data/;
                            push @cols,
                                +{
                                title => "After DATA EXIF",
                                align => "center",
                                };
                            my $sep = \'│';
                            
                            my $major_sep = \'║';
                            my $tb        = Text::Table->new( $sep, " Data Number ", $major_sep,
                                ( map { +( ( ref($_) ? $_ : " $_ " ), $sep ) } @cols ) );
                            
                            my $num_cols = @cols;

                            # load table 
                            foreach (keys %$infofinalgen) {
                                $tb->load( [1, $_,    $$infofinalgen{$_}] );
                                #print "\033[37m[ \033[34mEXIT DATA \033[37m] \033[32m $_ => $$info{$_}\n";
                            }


                            my $make_rule = sub {
                                my ($args) = @_;
                            
                                my $left      = $args->{left};
                                my $right     = $args->{right};
                                my $main_left = $args->{main_left};
                                my $middle    = $args->{middle};
                            
                                return $tb->rule(
                                    sub {
                                        my ( $index, $len ) = @_;
                            
                                        return ( '─' x $len );
                                    },
                                    sub {
                                        my ( $index, $len ) = @_;
                            
                                        my $char = (
                                            ( $index == 0 )             ? $left
                                            : ( $index == 1 )             ? $main_left
                                            : ( $index == $num_cols + 1 ) ? $right
                                            :                               $middle
                                        );
                            
                                        return $char x $len;
                                    },
                                );
                            };

            That is a simple part of the script which takes args in 
            and formats them into the table while also matching it with the input 
            of the EXIF and the naming of the file

            now so when the URL is done and injected or created with the barcode 
            it will tell you what URL was imbedded into which named file 
            this makes it easier for you to filter out which barcode 
            you truly want to send

            we also get the same table telling us that the data of the image was
            pulled and parsed into the data table 

            # thanks for the perl docuentation i was able to learn about the 
            # text table code shown here

            So- thanks yall XD

            once done the perl is imediatly going to check if the file exists
            and if it does it will continue and move on if not it will output an error
            but keep going, 

            NOTE: QR CODE LIST GENERATION CAN BE VERY VERY INACCURATE WHEN IT COMES TO 
            MAKING CONSTANT REQUESTS AND GENERATING FILES, FILES OR PNG BARCODES MAY OVER 
            WRITE EACH OTHER WITHOUT USER KNOWING DUE TO THE CHANCES OF THE SAME STRING 
            GENERATING AS A NAME

            <div class="ascii-art">
                working with steganograhy in perl/RR5
                so this is exactly like the RR5 script where you can generate 
                QR codes with a list of URL's and without a list of URL's
                i told you about the basic data of the table but not what the full 
                thing was or what it actually did

                this command is still in development as i am learning binary formats and 
                data reading with perl/go, and as i advance i will eventually add 
                finding the binary offsets and the headers and verifying or identifying 
                what file is which by using regex to search for and match the binary headers

                however this one is a bit different, instead of hex dumping QR codes and basic 
                image formats like .png then we can use this tool to dump any file

                the command we will be using is EXIF

                this command will alow us to gather basic data on a image file 
                and dump it into a table format 

                now simply im going to use a file called bear.jpg

                just a simple picture of a bear

                when we run the command EXIF we are asked for the path mind 
                is my home dir with the filename bear.jpg
                when we run that and hit enter we ghet the following output

                | IGNORE THIS, idk why its there
                [ WARN ] GENERAL: EXIF DATA COLLECTED: QR CODE GENERATED

                so first we have the same table as when we generated 
                the QR codes but lets go through the table 

                what are the constant '1's in the same rows and columns 

                well simple, it tells if a value returns true or false like here
                it checks if the file information is true or not


                : perl code example :

                my $file = "/usr/test/file1.txt";
                my (@description, $size);
                if (-e $file) {
                push @description, 'binary' if (-B _);
                push @description, 'a socket' if (-S _);
                push @description, 'a text file' if (-T _);
                push @description, 'a block special file' if (-b _);
                push @description, 'a character special file' if (-c _);
                push @description, 'a directory' if (-d _);
                push @description, 'executable' if (-x _);
                push @description, (($size = -s _)) ? "$size bytes" : 'empty';
                }

                END_____:

                if this is eq to the description or form -d, -e etc etc then it will 
                format and push the description bool value into the table format function

                then you have COL #2 which is named data 

                this si the general data, here you will get the following

                ║EncodingProcess
                ║XResolution
                ║ResolutionUnit
                ║ImageHeight
                ║ImageSize
                ║ImageWidth
                ║FileAccessDate
                ║FileSize
                ║FileType
                ║FileInodeChangeDate│
                etc etc 

                this will chnage via file but its pretty easy to understand the base of this 
                data, when RR 5.5 comes out i will be adding a binary image injection to really
                truly impliment data steganograhy with go, i will allow a method in perl to use the 
                base functions like in the bianry scanner, to scan and read thr data, and pass it 
                back to the go file which will finally give you the option to inject the image or view 
                the hidden data at a certian offset in image formats like JPEG Certificate's

                [+] Loading Standard Exploit.....



                this one was pretty cool to actually work with and experiment, there 
                is nothing to do that requires user interaction other than telling you 
                in gneral what the dirty cow exploit is and how it works directly, 
                and ofc showing the rewrite

                so first off a breif breif description of dirty cow is just a 
                Local Privlege Escalation exploit for all versions of the Linux Kernel 
                since version 2.6. 22 but has been patched in newer versions

                now the simple part of this is just explaining how it works which is 
                just by exploiting the kernals COW ( Copy On Write ) which is a function
                which is kalled in the kernal to in a sense hand data over or copy data to 
                another file.

                here is a thing i found a while back on understanding the dirty cow exploit

                `````````````````
                First, we create a private copy (mapping) of a read-only file. Second, we write to the private copy. Since it's our first time writing to the private copy, the COW feature takes place. The problem lies in the fact that this write consists of two non-atomic actions:

                    locate physical address
                    write to physical address

                This means we can get right in the middle (via another thread) and tell the kernel to throw away our private copy — using madvise. This throwing away of the private copy results in the kernel accidentally writing to the original read-only file.
                write	madvise
                locate physical address	
                  throw away private copy
                write to physical address	

                For a more detailed visual explanation, check out our demo page. It'll be fun!
                ````````````````````

                now since i was learning go when i came across Dirty COW i decided to rewrite 
                it in go, with newer functions and better ends, given how close C and go are it 
                wasnt to hard to rewrite the exploit

A yes we finally bring ourselves to the GHOSTED shell, first this is diffucult 
for some people to process so lets get the basics down, this is a 

VERY VERY DANGEROUS APPLICATION AND SHELL TO REMOVE OR CORRUPT OPERATING SYSTEMS 
FAST, THis has been tested and i can say from testing this shell if you are on 
linux or mac will completely erase EVEYRHTING this includes the following 

Plugged in USB drives 
Extra HDD's/SSD's with the same filesystem
cirrecupt and possibly kill drives 
erase any and all partitions
Kill all network settings and will deface every file in your filepath

I HIGHLY SUGGEST BEFORE USING THIS YOU 100% WANT TO RUN THIS SCRIPT EVEN THOUGH 

YOU KNOW THERE IS ALMOST 100% CHANCE OF IT KILLING ALL DRIVES AND CONNECTED SYSTEMS 

THIS WILL ACT ALOT LIKE BOOTWARE WHICH WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BOOT INTO YOUR DEVICE

OR OS AGAIN UNTIL PROPER RESTORE IS FINISHED, NOTE ONCE YOU ENTER THE COMMANDS THERE

IS

NO

GOING

BACK


** Scare security warned you **

Now lets actually get into what this tool is, so if you dont know a while back i posted a shell 
just like this in C which here is a small code snippet of what it looked like

#include stdio.h
#include stdlib.h
#include string.h 
#include time.h
/////////////// COLORING /////////////////////////
#define BLK "\e[0;30m"
#define RED "\e[0;31m"
#define GRN "\e[0;32m"
#define YEL "\e[0;33m"
#define BLU "\e[0;34m"
#define MAG "\e[0;35m"
#define CYN "\e[0;36m"

//Regular bold
#define BBLK "\e[1;30m"
#define BRED "\e[1;31m"
#define BGRN "\e[1;32m"
... more and more colors

int main(){
    printf("\x1b[H\x1b[2J\x1b[3J");
    char response[5];
    time_t t = time(NULL);
    struct tm tm = *localtime(&t);
    printf("\e[0;35m***********************************************\n\e[0;35m");
    printf("\e[0;35m*         GHOST UTERM FOR OS-REM              *\n\e[0;35m");
    printf("\e[0;35m*           %d-%02d-%02d %02d:%02d:%02d               *\n\e[0;35m", tm.tm_year + 1900, tm.tm_mon + 1, tm.tm_mday, tm.tm_hour, tm.tm_min, tm.tm_sec);
    printf("\e[0;35m*                                             *\n\e[0;35m");
    printf("\e[0;35m***********************************************\n\e[0;35m");
    printf("\e[0;91mOperating System -> ");
    scanf("%s", response);
    if (strcmp(response, "windows")==0){
        char wina[5];
        printf("\n\e[0;36m[\e[0;35m?\e[0;36m] This OS is recognizeed as a windows system\n");
        printf("\n\e[0;36m[\e[0;35m?\e[0;36m] Would you like to reset, crash, or remove it\n");
        printf("\n\e[0;36m[\e[0;35m?\e[0;36m] re - reset |      \n");
        printf("Options -> ");
        scanf("%s", wina);
        if (strcmp(wina, "re")==0){
            printf("\n\e[0;33m[+] Starting command.....\n");
            printf("\n\e[0;33m[+] Executing......\n");
            system("sleep 2");
            system("systemreset -factoryreset");
        }
    }



this small script would detect your OS based off what OS the user chose, and reset or kill the 

entire operating system, this is a complete rewrite and overhual of this script and its also in go 

with safer features and more commands 

we can execute this shell by typing the command 

ghosted in the RR5 terminal, once done we get the following output

					______  _     _  _____  _______ _______ _______ ______ 
					|  ____ |_____| |     | |______    |    |______ |     \

Wow big list right? okay its not too bad, lets go through the table of data header first 

First we have command which is the command you will run 

the type which specifies wether or not interaction is needed 

if its a string then interction is needed by the user 



Now this script is a mix of inline C/ASM and Powered mainly by go, to get the host information 

like the cpu or general information it will work along side of C and inline assembly mixed in 

with the inline assembly to gather that data, here is an example of the code that works as such 


//}
////grab the cpu based data
//int a[10];
//void brandString(int eaxValues)
//{
//    if (eaxValues == 1) {
//    __asm__("mov $0x80000002 , %eax\n\t");
//    }
//    else if (eaxValues == 2) {
//        __asm__("mov $0x80000003 , %eax\n\t");
//    }
//    else if (eaxValues == 3) {
//        __asm__("mov $0x80000004 , %eax\n\t");
//    }
//    __asm__("cpuid\n\t");
//    __asm__("mov %%eax, %0\n\t":"=r" (a[0]));
//    __asm__("mov %%ebx, %0\n\t":"=r" (a[1]));
//    __asm__("mov %%ecx, %0\n\t":"=r" (a[2]));
//    __asm__("mov %%edx, %0\n\t":"=r" (a[3]));
//    printf("%s", &a[0]);
//}
//
//void getCpuID()
//{
//    __asm__("xor %eax , %eax\n\t");
//    __asm__("xor %ebx , %ebx\n\t");
//    __asm__("xor %ecx , %ecx\n\t");
//    __asm__("xor %edx , %edx\n\t");
//    printf("CPU is => ");
//    brandString(1);
//    brandString(2);
//    brandString(3);
//    printf("\n");
//}


pulled from the following assembly script i made a while back


section .data ;tell it to work
        string db "Current Branded CPU => > XXXXXXXXXXXX > ",0xA
section .text
global _start
_start:
       xor eax,eax
       cpuid 
       mov edi,string
       mov [edi+25],ebx ;why am i doing this 
       mov [edi+29],edx
       mov [edi+33],ecx
       mov eax,4
       mov ebx,1
       mov ecx,string
       mov edx,41
       int 0x80 ; i hate myself for ever thinking i could be good at this lang XD
       mov eax,1
       xor ebx,ebx
       int 0x80 ; finally that took a while 


The assmembly script would grab your vendor ID of your CPU, i found a way to inline assembly 

with c and impliment C into go so i took the exact same concept and snapped it in with a little 

help from some old UNIX/LINUX ASM forums which people were talking about getting hardware vendor 

ID's


so when you cun the following command cpu in the ghosted terminal you get this as an example 

CPU is => AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor             

this is my current CPU but yours will change 

if you have intel it will pop up as GENUIN INTEL

etc etc

now another example of the working inline c code is when we use the sys-inf tag or command 

in the terminal which will give us an output as 

|System Name             |=> Linux
|                        |Node/System Name        |=> XE43P3R
|                        |System Current Version  |=> #1 SMP Debian 5.14.9-9parrot1 (2021-10-26)
|                        |Release Version         |=> 5.14.0-9parrot1-amd64
|                        |Machine ARCH            |=> x86_64

coming from here 


//    struct utsname buf1;
//    errno =0;
//    if(uname(&buf1)!=0)
//    {
//        perror("Error => Uname returned 0");
//        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
//    }
//    printf("|System Name             |=> %s\n", buf1.sysname);
//    printf("|                        ");
//    printf("|Node/System Name        |=> %s\n", buf1.nodename);
//    printf("|                        ");
//    printf("|System Current Version  |=> %s\n", buf1.version);
//    printf("|                        ");
//    printf("|Release Version         |=> %s\n", buf1.release);
//    printf("|                        ");
//    printf("|Machine ARCH            |=> %s\n", buf1.machine);
//}


now this shell has some pretty unique things to it but ill spare you the simple shit 

and move onto the more dangerous / fucked up commands

so in this shell it currently upports the reset / destruction of 2 main filesystems

/ -> Linux

and 

\ -> windows

now i will have you know before hand the way the assembly was written will vary 

wether or not it will work for your operating system, as when you write assembly 

you spceify it twards The OS type, filesystem, BIT, and CPU that you are running 

that is if you are writing stuff like this

I think by the command title you will know what they do, however this is where it becomes extremely tricky

so during development of this shell and RR5 i setup a spceified OS on a whole new HDD with no VM on it which 

means the OS was basically hard installed onto that drive, and well i decided to un the command kill-linux which 

would literally delete the entire os from the / dir up, to my knowlege i didnt which is also why RR5's 

production was soon to be delayed at this moment so many times, when you run this command it will auto detect 

your main or running operating system, if you are on windows you can use the command kill-linux and it will just tell you 

hey ro your not on a linux machine so im going to just factoryreset your windows system and this will also 

go based off of your system ARCH if you are 32 the commands that are executed change which is called 

in the code block seen here as an example the person uses the command kill-linux and you are on a mac 

golang will call the linux function but also use the RUNTIME.GOOS function to test if the os is right 

if not it calls the C function to test the OS again and if it comes back false, it will detect the OS and 

prompt the shell

code block seen here

//    #elif TARGET_OS_MAC
//        char command[] = "xartutil --erase-all";
//        printf("\x1b[H\x1b[2J\x1b[3J");
//        char response[10];
//        time_t t = time(NULL);
//        struct tm tm = *localtime(&t);
//        printf("\e[0;35m***********************************************\n\e[0;35m");
//        printf("\e[0;35m*         GHOST UTERM FOR OS-REM              *\n\e[0;35m");
//        printf("\e[0;35m*           %d-%02d-%02d %02d:%02d:%02d               *\n\e[0;35m", tm.tm_year + 1900, tm.tm_mon + 1, tm.tm_mday, tm.tm_hour, tm.tm_min, tm.tm_sec);
//        printf("\e[0;35m*                                             *\n\e[0;35m");
//        printf("\e[0;35m***********************************************\n\e[0;35m");
//        printf("\e[0;91m[-] Operating System Detected -> MAC OS\n\n");
//        printf("\e[0;91m[-] Operating System Arch     -> 32\n\n");
//        printf("-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------");
//        printf("\e[0;91m[+] hitting Enter : Will continue with the deletion/factory reset process\n");
//        printf("\e[0;91m[*] it is suggested that you read the documentation, if you have not yet ");
//        printf("\e[0;91m[*] please do exit out of this script with crtl+c and reading the danger ");
//        printf("\e[0;91m[*] documentation and the potential damages that could occur ");

//        printf("running")
//        system(command);
//    #else
//        print



now lets move onto the dangers 

as described in the beggining of this documentation the commands to kill or even reset 

your OS are very dangerous and unstable, even if it is a system command it can still cause 

damage that can not be reversed, it is highly suggested you check this before you keep going 

forward, there is not much to this other than it gets lower end level system information 

and will gladly hapily kill your os for you

               in this mess of a project i decided to add two modules for myself and this script 

                one written in ruby the other written in go, so to add a little twist to red rabbit 

                i decided to include the SHODAN API and work with the GO MSF API to get sessions


                in the offical RR5 path main where you load RR5's main file you have a file named 

                config-files when you open it you see the follwoing

                shodan-API-KEY.txt
                blacklist.txt
                popcommands.txt
                token.conf

                the one we will be paying attention to will be the following two 

                shodan-API-KEY.txt

                blacklist.txt 


                in RR5 there are a few command for shodan which render the following

                |-> basic-shod | Run a basic shodan search on a host or search term                        |Working |
                |-> port-shod  | Run a basic SHODAN scan to find the ports of a host                       |Working |
                |-> acc-shod   | Get basic information on youe shodan API                                  |Working |
                |-> hon-shod   | Test the probability of a ip address being a honeypot                     |Working |
                |-> asy-shod   | Use async to grab the probability of an IP being a honeypot [shodan]      |Working |


                these commands all use the SHODAN API KEY .txt file to load ill show you why here 

                in the modules shodan.rb i have this chunk here


                module Shodan_Main
                    # start by reading the config-files for a shodan API key
                    # For more information on the SHODAN module please turn to the 12 index of the offical RR5 documentation
                    # chap -> shodanz
                    # basic search
                    def Shodan_Main.Basic_search(host, api_key)
                        api = Shodanz.client.new(key: "#{api_key}")
                        res = api.host_search("#{host}")
                        puts "Current results -> #{res['total']}"
                        res['matches'].each do |result|
                            puts "IP: #{result['ip_str']}"
                            puts result['data'] + "\n"
                        end
                    end



                this chunk takes the following as arguments 

                ( host, api_key )

                these are called in the main rr5 list like this

                            api_ = File.open("config-files/shodan-API-KEY.txt")
                            key_ = api_.read
                            puts "Key => #{key_}"
                            Shodan_Main.get_api("#{key_}")

                this presets the main file as the path to the SHODAN API config file

                when you want to use the shodan modules simply open up the empty txt file

                you will see this 



                # set key here make sure to completely remove this line


                completely remove this line and input your key at the very top of the file 

                the file should look like this 


                aexamplerandomapikeshodan

                in this case that will be your API KEY

                once done save the file in the same directory and re run the commands, now you are all 
                set to go with the files and the proper information to run the shodan modules

                shodan module usage is declared on the other end



                NOW lets move to the other configuration file, blacklist.txt, this isnt a 100% needed 

                of a file but this is used for the command 

                dm-b

                this is a simple domain blocker, basically you input a bunch of hosts in a filename 

                you cha use this configuration but if you dont want to you are prompted to 



                If you are having trouble understanding please
                                refer to the documentation, module 7 chapter 1 
                                for further instructions
                _____________________________________________
                Please enter the path of the config file > 

                Filepath > 



                which will allow you to open a file say /usr/share/wordlists/hosts.txt

                which in hosts.txt we have 

                www.google.com
                www.hulu.com
                www.caleb.com
                www.example.com

                once we enter the filepath or have the blacklist.txt file inputted and filled out we can now 

                hit enter 


                when you hit enter and the file is real you will get an extrmely large output like this

                [ ? ] Connection was established? was host down or blocked? ->  &{{0xc00052e580}}




                first lets break this down, when we frst enter we get host information 

                the hosts in the file and the time the script started, now what this script is tying to do 

                is trying to write the hosts to your etc/hosts file and block them by making a private connection 

                and formatting pre written templates which will parse correctly in a way to the file to direct 

                all domain connections in that file to the loopback which will give your browser the error 


                this connection is not private


                if all is red then this means good, it will first make a GET request to the host before hand 

                if it checks as a URL it will write it to the file, and check again, if you get the MSG 


                [ ? ] Connection was established? was host down or blocked? ->  &{{0xc000024800}}


                this means that the file was written to correctly and host was blocked correctly







                Working with the matasploit API to gather current and running sessions 


                i will say this ones a bit buggy but simple, when you do run the comamnd MSF_Session

                you WILL NEED TO HAVE EXPORTED THE SESSION USER/HOST AND PASS LOCAL ENVIROMENT VARIABLES

                like this

                EXPORT MSFHOST
                EXPORT MSFPASS


                once done you will get a simple output showing how much jobs there are running as said above 

                this is still currently in development be patient XD
