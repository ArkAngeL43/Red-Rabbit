WARNING: MOST CODE IN THIS DIRECTORY `SUPER-MODS` ARE ALL PRE GENERATED BRICKS, STRUCTURES, CONSTANTS, VARIABLE LISTS, IMPORT LISTS ETC ARE ALL A RESULT OF PRE CODE GENERATORS FROM PREVIOUS 

CONFIGURATION FILES, NOTE THIS GENERATOR USED WAS PROPERTY OF THE RED RABBIT DEVELOPERS AND IS NOT A CREDABLE SOURCE, SINCE NO SOURCE CODE FOR THE GENERATOR WILL BE RELEASED, ALL CODE WAS BASED 

ON TEMPLATES AND WAS NOT MANUALLY EDDITED BY ANY DEVELOPER, ONLY NAMES AND THINGS MANUALLY CHANGED WERE THE TYPE NAMES, CONSTANT NAMES, DEFINITION NAMES, VARIABLE NAMES ETC TO PREVENT CODE CONFLICTION 

ALSO GIVEN EXTRA MODULES, THIS DOES NOT FALL FOR ALL CODE, AS ONLY MAJOR FILES SUCH AS LOGGERS, TARGET GENERATORS, FILE PARSERS, ETC ARE ALL PRE GENERATED, API READERS AND WRITERS AND PROGRAMS ARE NOT 

PRE GENERATED.

the generator works by scraping numerous websites like stackoverflow and forums for certian code based on the templates it is given, once it finds code based on the settings.ini file we have set for the generator 

the code is then checked for copywrite if it comes back false it is appended to a list which is then thrown into the templates and pre generated, NO CODE IN THIS BRICK, FILEPATH, OR PROJECT THAT IS PRE GENERATED IS 

TAKEN, OR COPIED FROM ANY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN SOURCES. CONTACT THE DEV TEAM FOR MORE INFORMATION OR IF YOU FEEL THE CODE THAT WAS AUTO GENERATED WAS YOUR CODE, AS WE WILL DISCUSS SOURCES AND REMOVE IT FROM RED RABBITS 

CODE BASE TO PROTECT BOTH OUR USERS AND DEVELOPERS WHICH INCLUDES YOURSELF, GIVEN YOU ARE A VICTIM OF A MISTAKE AND FLAW IN OUR AUTO GENERATOR.
